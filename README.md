# Virtual Tourist

This is an app for iOS, and one of the projects composing Udacity's iOS nanodegree. It is intended to demonstrate the student's grasp of persistence in iOS using Core Data. The spec for the app is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-UIi1jJGuNWKoEjEk09wwYf4ebefnwcVrUYbiHh1MI/pub?embedded=true).

This version of the app implements the spec and adds some features:
- On the map view, pins can be deleted using the Edit button on the nav bar.
- On the map view, the location of the pin can be changed by finger-dragging. This only works during the initial long press which created the pin.
- On the photo view, multiple photos can be selected for deletion at once.
